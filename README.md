Eventually intended to include career stats for every player in NPB, KBO, and CPBL history.

**If you speak Korean or Japanese and want to help me transliterate KBO or NPB names, please let me know via the "issues" tab.**
**If you have corrections, please contact me the same way.**

Currently contains:
* CPBL batting and pitching stats, 1990-2019, with names in Mandarin and English. Does not include birth dates.
* KBO batting, pitching, and fielding stats, 1982-2019 and part of 2020, with names in Korean. Includes birth dates. Very unlikely to be updated with additional 2020 stats until end of season.

In progress:
* Gathering NPB stats and birth dates

To do in the relatively near future:
* Translate/Romanize KBO names
* Gather CPBL birth dates

Eventually:
* Combine the three leagues into one collective database
* Track down CPBL fielding stats, particularly games played by position

Sources: Mostly the official CPBL, KBO, and NPB websites with some minor additional digging at statiz.co.kr, baseball-reference.com, and npbstats.com.
