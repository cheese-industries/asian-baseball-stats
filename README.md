Eventually intended to include career stats for every player in NPB, KBO, and CPBL history.

If you speak Korean or Japanese and want to help me transliterate KBO or NPB names, please let me know via the "issues" tab. If you have corrections, please contact me the same way.

Currently contains:
* CPBL batting and pitching stats, 1990-2019, with names in Mandarin and English. Does not include birth dates.
* KBO batting, pitching, and fielding stats, 1982-2019 and part of 2020, with names in Korean. Includes birth dates. Very unlikely to be updated with additional 2020 stats until end of season.

In progress:
* Gathering NPB stats and birth dates

To do in the relatively near future:
* Translate/Romanize KBO names
* Gather CPBL birth dates

Eventually:
* Combine the three leagues into one collective database
* Track down CPBL fielding stats, particularly games played by position

Sources: Mostly the official CPBL, KBO, and NPB websites with some minor additional digging at statiz.co.kr, baseball-reference.com, and npbstats.com.
